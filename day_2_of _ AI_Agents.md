# Oracle SQL Based Query Optimization System

## 1. Why Move from AWS Redshift to Oracle SQL?

During the initial design phase, AWS Redshift was considered as the core database.  
However, after reviewing AWS documentation, even a small Redshift setup (Workload size: Small, 4 RPUs, ~1 hour daily runtime) costs around **$45.75 per month**.  

For practice and development purposes, this cost is **not feasible**.  
Also, from a **functional perspective**:

- **Oracle SQL** and **AWS Redshift** both support SQL queries and feel very similar for query writing.  
- **Oracle SQL / Database** â†’ a **general-purpose RDBMS**, good for both transactions and analytics.  
- **AWS Redshift** â†’ a **specialized data warehouse**, best for large-scale analytics.  

ðŸ‘‰ Since the primary focus is **building and testing AI sub-agents for query optimization**, Oracle SQL is sufficient and cost-effective at this stage.  
Later, the same solution can be migrated or validated on Redshift if required.

## 2. Execution Plan

If approved, the plan is as follows:

### Phase 1: Local / Oracle SQL Development
1. Set up Oracle SQL (On-Prem or Oracle RDS).  
2. Create a **Sandbox Database (read-only clone)** for safe testing.  
3. Implement core AI sub-agents as microservices:  
   - Query Optimizer  
   - Schema Advisor  
   - Cost Advisor  
   - Data Validator  

### Phase 2: Integration
1. Build an **Application / API Layer** (Controller) that:  
   - Receives user queries  
   - Passes them to AI sub-agents  
   - Directs queries to either Sandbox or Main Oracle DB  
   - Returns results back to the user  

2. Implement **Monitoring & Feedback** to log:  
   - Original vs Optimized queries  
   - Execution performance (time, cost impact)  
   - Validation feedback  

### Phase 3: Future Migration (Optional)
- If required, migrate the system to **AWS Redshift** with minimal changes, since the agents work on SQL-level queries.

## 3. System Design
The following architecture focuses on **Oracle SQL**:
```
    +-------------+
    |   User /    |
    |   Client    |
    +------+------+ 
           |
           v
    +------------------+
    |   Application /  |
    |   API Layer      |
    | (Controller)     |
    +--------+---------+
             |
             v
    +------------------+
    |  AI Sub-Agents   |
    | (Local Services) |
    +------------------+
    | - Query Optimizer|
    | - Schema Advisor |
    | - Cost Advisor   |
    | - Data Validator |
    +--------+---------+
             |
    +--------+---------+
    |                  |
    v                  v
+------------------+   +----------------------+
|  Oracle SQL DB   |   |  Read-Only Sandbox   |
| (Main Database)  |   |   (Testing Clone)    |
+--------+---------+   +----------+-----------+
             |                  |
             +--------+---------+
                      |
                      v
              +------------------+
              | Monitoring &     |
              |   Feedback       |
              +--------+---------+
                        |
                        v
                +-------------+
                |   User      |
                |   Client    |
                +-------------+

## 4. End-to-End Workflow

1. **User / Client** submits a query to the **API Layer**.  
2. The **API Layer (Controller)** passes the query to the **AI Sub-Agents**.  
3. The **AI Sub-Agents** analyze and optimize the query:  
   - Query Optimizer â†’ rewrites queries for performance  
   - Schema Advisor â†’ suggests schema/index improvements  
   - Cost Advisor â†’ estimates resource usage impact  
   - Data Validator â†’ checks correctness of results  
4. Optimized queries are sent to the **Oracle SQL Sandbox DB** for testing.  
   - Once validated, they can be run on the **Main Oracle SQL DB**.  
5. **Monitoring & Feedback** captures performance comparisons and logs.  
6. Results (optimized query + analysis) are returned to the **User**.

## 5. Benefits of Using Oracle SQL (Now)

- **Cost-effective** â†’ avoids Redshift monthly charges.  
- **Safe Testing** â†’ Sandbox ensures production data is not impacted.  
- **Same Learning Value** â†’ SQL optimization skills apply equally to Oracle and Redshift.  
- **Future Ready** â†’ The architecture is flexible to migrate to Redshift later.

## 6. Next Steps

- Await confirmation to proceed with Oracle SQL setup.  
- Begin implementing the AI sub-agents and API layer.  
- Validate the workflow end-to-end in the Sandbox environment.
